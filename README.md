# python-final-project

This repository contains the files for my final project in the Python navigation course.

## Contents

* `covid_data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization code.
* `owid-covid-data.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
3.  Run Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
4.  Open the `covid_data.ipynb` file in your browser.
5.  You can then run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is from the `owid-covid-data.csv` file, which likely originates from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations).
